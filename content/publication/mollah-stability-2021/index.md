abstract: This paper presents computational fluid dynamics simulations of the deposition
  flow during printing of multiple layers in material extrusion additive manufacturing.
  The developed model predicts the morphology of the deposited layers and captures
  the layer deformations during the printing of viscoplastic materials. The physics
  is governed by the continuity and momentum equations with the Bingham constitutive
  model, formulated as a generalized Newtonian fluid. The cross-sectional shapes of
  the deposited layers are predicted, and the defor­ mation of layers is studied for
  different constitutive parameters of the material. It is shown that the deformation
  of layers is due to the hydrostatic pressure of the printed material, as well as
  the extrusion pressure during the extrusion. The simulations show that a higher
  yield stress results in prints with less deformations, while a higher plastic viscosity
  leads to larger deformations in the deposited layers. Moreover, the influence of
  the printing speed, extrusion speed, layer height, and nozzle diameter on the deformation
  of the printed layers is investigated. Finally, the model provides a conservative
  estimate of the required increase in yield stress that a viscoplastic material demands
  after deposition in order to support the hydrostatic and extrusion pressure of the
  subsequently printed layers.
