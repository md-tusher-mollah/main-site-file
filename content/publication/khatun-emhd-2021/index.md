abstract: This study is performed on the numerical investigation of electro-magnetohydrodynamic
  (EMHD) radiating fluid flow nature along an infinitely long vertical Riga plate
  with suction in a rotating system. The prevailing equations are generated from the
  Navier–Stokes’ and energy equations. A uniform suction velocity is introduced to
  control the flow. The prevailing boundary layer (BL) equations are the stuff to
  delineate the mechanical features of the flowing nature along with the electromagnetic
  device (Riga plate). Accordingly, the use of usual transformations on the equations
  transformed those into a coupled dimensionless system of non-linear partial differential
  equations (PDEs). After conversion, the elucidation of the set of equations is conducted
  numerically by an explicit finite difference method (FDM). The criteria for stable
  and converging solutions are constructed to find restrictions on various non-dimensional
  parameters. The retrieved restrictions are Pr ≥ 0.19,Rd ≥ 0.1,S ≥ 1, Ec = 0.01and
  0 textless R ≤ 0.1 . Furthermore, sensitivity tests on mesh and time as well as
  comparison within the literature have been demonstrated in graphical and tabular
  form. Finally, the important findings of the non-dimensional parameters influences
  have been portrayed in graphical manner by using the MATLAB R2015a tool. A substantial
  uprise is noted for both the velocities (secondary and primary) under the rising
  actions of the modified Hartmann number, whereas the suction parameter suppresses
  both the velocities.
