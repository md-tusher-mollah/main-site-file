abstract: The fluid flow and heat transfer through a rotating curved duct has received
  much attention in recent years because of vast applications in mechanical devices.
  It is noticed that there occur two different types of rotations in a rotating curved
  duct such as positive and negative rotation. The positive rotation through the curved
  duct is widely investigated while the investigation on the negative rotation is
  rarely available. The paper investigates the influence of negative rotation for
  a wide range of Taylor number (−10 ≤ Tr ≤ −2500) when the duct itself rotates about
  the center of curvature. Due to the rotation, three types of forces including Coriolis,
  centrifugal, and buoyancy forces are generated. The study focuses and explains the
  combined effect of these forces on the fluid flow in details. First, the linear
  stability of the steady solution is performed. An unsteady solution is then obtained
  by time-evolution calculation and flow transition is determined by calculating phase
  space and power spectrum. When Tr is raised in the negative direction, the flow
  behavior shows different flow instabilities including steadystate, periodic, multi-periodic,
  and chaotic oscillations. Furthermore, the pattern variations of axial and secondary
  flow velocity and isotherms are obtained, and it is found that there is a strong
  interaction between the flow velocities and the isotherms. Then temperature gradients
  are calculated which show that the fluid mixing and the acts of secondary flow have
  a strong influence on heat transfer in the fluid. Diagrams of unsteady flow and
  vortex structure are further sketched and precisely elucidate the curvature effects
  on unsteady fluid flow. Finally, a comparison between the numerical and experimental
  data is discussed which demonstrates that both data coincide with each other.
