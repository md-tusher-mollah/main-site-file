abstract: A conceptual boundary level experiment of heat and mass transfer ﬂow in
  an MHD viscous nanoﬂuid containing gyrotactic microorganisms around a stretching
  cylinder has been evaluated in this work. The governing equations of the ﬂow have
  been executed by the boundary layer phenomena. The primary non-linear PDEs have
  been turned into a dimensionless form via application of suitable dimensionless
  variables. The resulting non-similar dimensionless diﬀerential equations have been
  resolved by the EFDM with the help of FORTRAN software version 6.6a. Stability and
  convergence criteria analysis enabled obtaining the convergent solutions. The consequences
  of numerous parameters such as the Magnetic parameter, Brownian motion parameter,
  Thermophoresis parameter, Lewis number, Micro-organism Lewis number, and Bio-convection
  parameter on the ﬂow have been investigated, and the outcomes have been demonstrated
  graphically. Finally, the current outcomes were compared with the previously published
  results.
