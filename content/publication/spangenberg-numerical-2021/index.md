abstract: This paper presents a computational fluid dynamics model fit for multi-layer
  3D Concrete Printing. The numerical model utilizes an elasto-visco-plastic constitutive
  model to mimic the flow behaviour of the cementitious material. To validate the
  model, simulation data is compared to experimental data from 3D printed walls. The
  obtained results show that the numerical model can reproduce the experimental results
  with high accuracy and quantify the extrusion load imposed upon the layers. Such
  load is found to exceed the material’s yields stress in certain regions of previously
  printed layers, leading to layer deformation/flow. The developed and validated numerical
  model can assist in identifying optimal printing strategies, reducing the number
  of costly experimental print failures and human-process interaction. By doing so,
  the findings of this paper helps 3D Concrete Printing move a step closer to a truly
  digital fabrication process.
