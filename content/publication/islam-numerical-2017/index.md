abstract: The unsteady viscous compressible boundary layer fluid flow past a semi-infinite
  vertical porous plate surrounded in a porous medium with induced magnetic field
  has been studied numerically. The governing non-linear coupled partial differential
  equations have been transformed by using usual transformations. The obtained non-linear
  dimensionless coupled partial differential equations have been solved numerically.
  The explicit finite difference method is used as solution technique and MATLAB software
  is used as a secondary tool. The obtained results for the density, velocity, induced
  magnetic field as well as temperature distributions are shown graphically.
