abstract: The fluid flow along the Riga plate with the influence of magnetic force
  in a rotating system has been investigated numerically. The governing equations
  have been derived from Navier-Stokesâ€™ equations. Applying the boundary layer approximation,
  the appropriate boundary layer equations have been obtained. By using a usual transformation,
  the obtained governing equations have been transformed into a coupled dimensionless
  non-linear partial differential equation. The obtained dimensionless equations have
  been solved numerically by an explicit finite difference scheme. The simulated results
  have been obtained by using MATLAB R2015a. Also, the stability and convergence criteria
  have been analyzed. The effect of several parameters on the primary velocity, secondary
  velocity, temperature distributions as well as the local shear stress and the Nusselt
  number have been shown graphically.
