abstract: This paper presents a novel Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model that
  simulates the nonisothermal ﬂow of a viscoelastic ﬂuid through the hot-end in ﬁlament-based
  Material Extrusion Additive Manufacturing (MEX). The hot-end is an essential part
  of the printhead, as it melts and extrudes the polymeric material. Thus, robust
  modelling tools are necessary for optimising its operation. In this study, a viscoelastic
  CFD model is used to predict the ﬁlament feeding force and the results are validated
  against the experimental measurements at diﬀerent ﬁlament feeding rates, liqueﬁer
  temperatures, nozzle diameters and liqueﬁer lengths. It is found that the viscoelastic
  model is more accurate than the commonly used Generalised Newtonian Fluid approximation
  and it captures the inﬂuence of process conditions on the feeding force. Finally,
  the model is used to optimise the hot-end channel. Among others, it is shown that
  the feeding force can be minimised by selecting an optimal liqueﬁer diameter.
