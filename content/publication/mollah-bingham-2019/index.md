abstract: The numerical approach has been performed to study the Bingham fluid flow
  through an oscillatory porous plate with Ion-Slip and Hall current. Initially, at
  time; t  0 both the fluid and the upper plate are at rest. At time; t  0 the upper
  plate begins to oscillate in its own plane while the lower plate is stationary.
  The lower plate temperature is constant while the upper plate temperature has oscillated.
  A uniform magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the plates. To obtain the dimensionless
  equations from the governing non-linear partial differential equations, the usual
  transformations have been used. The explicit finite difference technique has been
  applied to solve the obtained dimensionless equations. The MATLAB R2015a has been
  used for numerical simulation. For the accuracy of the numerical technique, the
  stability and convergence criteria have been discussed and the system has found
  to be converged for Pr  0.08, i  2, Ha  20, k0  8 k  2 and Re  0.011 with
  e  0.10 , Ec  0.10 , Y  0.05 and   0.0001 . The steady-state solution has
  achieved at the dimensionless time   2.00 . At the steady-state time, the effect
  of several parameters on the flow patterns, local shear stress and the Nusselt number
  have been shown graphically.
