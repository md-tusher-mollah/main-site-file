abstract: Numerical investigation for unsteady, viscous, incompressible Bingham fluid
  flow through parallel plates is studied. The upper plate drifts with a constant
  uniform velocity and the lower plate is stationary. Both plates are studied at different
  fixed temperatures. To obtain the dimensionless equations, the governing equations
  for this study have been transformed by usual transformations. The obtained dimensionless
  equations are solved numerically using the explicit finite difference method (FDM).
  The studio developer Fortran (SDF) 6.6a and MATLAB R2015a are both used for numerical
  simulations. The stability criteria have been established and the system is converged
  for Prandtl number ùëÉ ‚â• 0.08 with Œîùëå = 0.05 and ŒîœÑ = 0.0001 as constants. As a key
  outcome, the steady-state solutions have been occurred for the dimensionless time
  œÑ = 4.00. The influence of parameters on the flow phenomena and on shear stress,
  including Nusselt number, are explained graphically. Finally, qualitative and quantitative
  comparison are shown.
