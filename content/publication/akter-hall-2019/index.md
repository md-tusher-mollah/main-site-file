abstract: The Hall effects on Casson fluid flow along a vertical plate has been investigated
  numerically. The governing equations have been derived from Navier-Stokesâ€™ equation
  and boundary layer approximation has been employed. By using usual transformations,
  the obtained non-linear coupled partial differential equations have been transformed
  into dimensionless governing equations. These equations have been solved by applying
  the explicit finite difference method. The MATLAB R2015a tool has been used for
  numerical simulation. The stability and convergence criteria have been analyzed.
  The effect of some important parameters on the primary velocity, secondary velocity,
  temperature and concentration distributions as well as local shear stress, Nusselt
  number and Sherwood number have been shown graphically.
