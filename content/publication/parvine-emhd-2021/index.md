abstract: This article pays attention to the numerical analysis of unsteady electro-magnetohydrodynamic
  (EMHD) Nanofluidic flow past a Riga plate of porosity criteria with thermal radiation.
  The flow is characterized under the assumption of radiation phenomena. Using the
  usual transformations, the non-dimensional mathematical model in the form of nonlinear
  coupled partial differential equations is renewed from the dimensional form. The
  interactions of thermophoretic and Brownian features for nanofluid are analyzed.
  The associated governing equations for the participated boundary settings are discretized
  and reckoned with by the explicit finite difference method (EFDM). The flow momentum,
  temperature, and concentration profiles along with shear stress, Nusselt number,
  and Sherwood number have been discussed graphically for sundry logical values of
  some important parameters. Also, to authenticate the novelty of this article, the
  possible sensitivities, and criteria of solutionsâ€Ÿ convergence along with stability
  have been demonstrated graphically and statistically.
