abstract: This paper investigates the stability of deformable layers produced by material
  extrusion additive manufacturing. A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model is
  developed to predict the deposition flow of viscoplastic ma­ terials such as ceramic
  pastes, thermosets, and concrete. The viscoplastic materials are modelled with the
  Bingham rheological equations and implemented with a generalized Newtonian fluid
  model. The developed CFD model applies a scalar approach to differentiate the rheology
  of two layers in order to capture the deposition of a wet layer onto a semi solidified
  printed layer (i.e., wet-on-semisolid printing). The semi solidification is modelled
  by a yield stress buildup. The cross-sectional shapes of the deposited layers are
  predicted, and the relative deformation of the first layer is studied for different
  yield stress buildups and processing conditions such as printing- and extrusion-speed,
  layer height, and nozzle diameter. The results of the CFD model illustrate that
  the relative deformation of the first layer decreases non-linearly with an increase
  in yield stress, and that stable prints can be obtained when taking into account
  the semi solidification. Furthermore, it is found that the deformation is dependent
  on a non-trivial interplay between the extrusion pressure, the shape of the cross-section,
  and the contact area between the layers. Finally, the results highlight which process
  conditions can be changed with benefit in order to limit the requirement on the
  yield stress buildup and still provide stable prints.
