abstract: Digital light processing (DLP) as a vat photopolymerization technique is
  one of the most popular three-dimensional (3D) printing methods, where chains are
  formed between liquid photocurable resin molecules to crosslink them and solidify
  the liquid resin using ultraviolet light. The DLP technique is inherently complex
  and the part accuracy depends on the process parameters that have to be chosen based
  on the fluid (resin) properties. In the present work, computational fluid dynamics
  (CFD) simulations are presented for top-down DLP as photocuring 3D printing. The
  effects of ﬂuid viscosity, travelling speed of build part, travelling speed ratio
  (ratio of the up-to-down traveling speeds of build part), printed layer thickness,
  and travel distance considering 13 various cases are scrutinized by the developed
  model to obtain a stability time of ﬂuid interface. The stability time describes
  the time it takes for the ﬂuid interface to show minimum ﬂuctuations. According
  to the simulations, a higher viscosity leads to prints with higher stability time.
  However, lower stability times in the printed layers are caused by a higher traveling
  speed ratio (TSR). The variation in settling times with TSR is extremely small in
  comparison to that of viscosity and travelling speed variations. As a result, a
  declining trend can be detected for the stability time by increasing the printed
  layer thickness, while by enhancing the travel distance values, the stability time
  demonstrated a descending pattern. In total, it was revealed that it is essential
  to choose optimal process parameters for achieving practical results. Moreover,
  the numerical model can assist in the optimizing the process parameters.
